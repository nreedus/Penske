Blood all over the inside of one of the two trucks I rented! I reserved two trucks one of the reservations got lost but they were able to get a truck from another location. When I picked up the second truck I noticed it was dirty, at the time I thought it was from someone hauling tires. I wasn"t happy but I needed the truck. I loaded the "clean" truck first then I loaded the "dirty" truck by this time it was almost dark I had use the cargo light to see. I paid no intention to the condition of the truck these spots I thought were from tires. I loaded in Missouri and took it to New Mexico. I unloaded the "dirty" truck in the morning as the sun was coming up and noticed a blood stain after unloading a few feet of the 26' truck. The first spot was nothing compared the the rest of the truck. the truck literally looked like a massacre happened on this truck. After I had the truck completely unloaded I drove it straight to the drop off which happened to be a corporate location and went in asking for a manager. 
       
..... I told the manager that he needed to come out and look at the back of this truck and he did. He had a loss for words but ended up talking some pictures. We went back in side and he asked me when the truck was do back I told him "tomorrow" then he said it would be taken care of then. I was flabbergasted. I thought he would call the police or atleast get me out of the rolling crime scene but he didn't. Since then I have spent the last six months trying to figure out what I was exposed to. I have been sent two lab reports that they claimed to have done on the truck(again no police). The first lab report had a date discrepancy so I called and got another copy of the report this time the conclusions were different and that report had a date discrepancy also. I believe both reports to have been falsified. I have spent the last six months wondering if I contracted something from this biohazard.
